# Keyless Transposition Program
This is a small program written in c++ which uses keyless transposition method to generate
a ciphertext string using the original string

## How to run program
instructions for compiling/running program using linux terminal:
- optionally: modify file keyless-transposition.cpp by changing string value assigned to fullName to some string you want to test
- install a c++ compiler (clang++, g++, ect.) if you don't have one installed
- `g++ keyless-transposition.cpp -o ktc` to create executable file `ktc` from the cpp file
- run the executable using command `./ktc`

note: the above instructions may differ slightly if using Windows
